This code creates a to-do list program that you can run from the command line.
It uses a library called "inquirer" to ask you questions and get your input.
It starts with an empty list of to-dos and asks what you want to do: add, edit, or delete a to-do.
If you choose to add, it asks you what to add and whether you want to add more.
If you choose to edit, it asks which to-do to edit and what the new value should be.
If you choose to delete, it asks which to-do to delete.
It keeps doing this until you say you don't want to add more.
If you try to edit or delete a to-do that doesn't exist, it tells you it's out of range.
